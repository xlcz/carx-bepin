A collection of BepinEx mods for CarX Drift Racing Online wrote in C#.

### No_Collision
A mod that automaticaly disables collisions locally through GameConsole upon joining a room.
Other players are unfortunately effected by this as it's client-side. I'm working to see if there's a server-side solution.
### No_UGC
Prevents UGC files from being downloaded by blocking the UGCManager update loop.
This stops often game breaking lag while being in a room or the lobby.
